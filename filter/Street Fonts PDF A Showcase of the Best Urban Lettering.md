## What are Street Fonts PDF Files?
  
Street fonts pdf files are digital documents that contain street fonts that you can download and install on your computer. Street fonts are fonts that mimic the style of graffiti art, which is a form of visual expression that uses spray paint, markers, stencils, stickers, or other tools to create images or text on walls, buildings, or other surfaces in public spaces.
  
Street fonts pdf files usually have the extension .pdf, which stands for Portable Document Format. PDF is a file format that preserves the layout, fonts, graphics, and other elements of a document regardless of the software or device used to view it. PDF files can be opened with various programs, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Preview.
  
Street fonts pdf files are different from street fonts ttf or otf files, which are the more common font file formats. TTF stands for TrueType Font, while OTF stands for OpenType Font. These file formats contain information about the glyphs, kerning, ligatures, and other features of a font. TTF and OTF files can be installed directly on your computer and used with any program that supports fonts.
  
Street fonts pdf files are useful for designers who want to preview how a street font looks before downloading and installing it. They are also handy for sharing street fonts with others who may not have the same font installed on their computer. However, street fonts pdf files cannot be used as fonts themselves. You will need to download and install the corresponding ttf or otf file of the street font if you want to use it in your design projects.
