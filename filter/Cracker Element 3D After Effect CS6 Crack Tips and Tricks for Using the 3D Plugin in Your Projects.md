## Using Element 3D
 
To use Element 3D, you need to create a new composition and a new solid layer in After Effects CS6. Then, apply the Element effect to the solid layer from the Effect tab. This will open the Element interface, where you can import 3D models, adjust settings, and preview your scene.
 
### Importing 3D Models
 
To import 3D models, you need to click on the Scene Setup button in the Element interface. This will open a new window where you can browse and load 3D models from your computer or from the Video Copilot library. You can also create basic 3D shapes using the primitives menu. Once you have imported your 3D models, you can arrange them in the scene, scale them, rotate them, and move them using the transform tools. You can also apply different materials and textures to your 3D models using the presets menu or by creating your own custom materials.
 
### Adding Lighting
 
To add lighting to your scene, you need to use After Effects' native lights. You can create a new light layer by going to Layer > New > Light. You can choose from different types of lights, such as spot, point, parallel, or ambient. You can also adjust the color, intensity, falloff, and shadow options of your lights. To make your lights affect your 3D models in Element 3D, you need to enable the Use Comp Lights option in the Render Settings tab of the Element interface.
 
### Rendering Your Scene
 
To render your scene, you need to close the Scene Setup window and go back to the main After Effects interface. You can preview your scene by scrubbing through the timeline or by hitting the RAM preview button. You can also animate your 3D models using keyframes or expressions. To export your scene as a video file, you need to add your composition to the render queue by going to Composition > Add to Render Queue. You can then choose your output format and settings and hit the Render button.
 
## Conclusion
 
Element 3D is a versatile and easy-to-use plug-in that allows you to create stunning 3D graphics in After Effects CS6. With Element 3D, you can import 3D models, apply materials, add lighting, and render realistic scenes in real time.
