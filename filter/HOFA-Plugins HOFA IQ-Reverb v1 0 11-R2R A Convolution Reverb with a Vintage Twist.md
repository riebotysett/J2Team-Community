The HOFA IQ-Reverb v1 0 11-R2R is the latest version of the plugin, which includes some improvements and bug fixes. It also comes with a library of 135 high-quality impulse responses and 95 presets, covering various categories such as room, ambience, chamber, hall, church, plate, space, spring, FX, reverse, hybrid and cabinet. Some of the impulse responses are true stereo, and the presets make good use of the algorithmic parameters.
 
The plugin has a scalable GUI that features a 3D IR spectrogram that shows the frequency and time characteristics of the selected impulse response. Many parameters can be adjusted both on the spectrogram and in the parameter boxes at the top and bottom. The plugin also has a position control for placing the source signal in the stereo field and in the depth of the reverb space. Additionally, the plugin has an onboard test signal player for auditioning the reverb sound with different sources.
