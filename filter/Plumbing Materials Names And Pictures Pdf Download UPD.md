## The Types of Plumbing Materials and Their Uses
  
Plumbing materials can be classified into four main categories: pipes, fittings, fixtures, and accessories. Each category has different types of materials that serve different purposes. Here is a brief overview of each category and some examples of plumbing materials:
  
### Pipes
  
Pipes are cylindrical tubes that carry liquids from one point to another. Pipes can be made of various materials, such as metal, plastic, or clay. The most common types of pipes used in plumbing are:

- Copper pipes: These are durable, corrosion-resistant, and easy to bend and join. They are used for water supply lines, refrigeration lines, and gas lines.
- PVC pipes: These are plastic pipes that are lightweight, inexpensive, and resistant to chemicals and corrosion. They are used for drain, waste, and vent (DWV) systems, irrigation systems, and sewer lines.
- CPVC pipes: These are plastic pipes that have higher temperature and pressure ratings than PVC pipes. They are used for hot water supply lines and fire sprinkler systems.
- PEX pipes: These are flexible plastic pipes that are easy to install and resistant to freezing and bursting. They are used for water supply lines in residential and commercial buildings.
- Galvanized steel pipes: These are metal pipes that have a zinc coating to prevent rusting. They are used for water supply lines and gas lines in older buildings.
- Cast iron pipes: These are heavy metal pipes that are durable and quiet. They are used for drain, waste, and vent (DWV) systems in older buildings.

### Fittings
  
Fittings are connectors that join pipes or change the direction or size of pipes. Fittings can be made of various materials, such as metal, plastic, or rubber. The most common types of fittings used in plumbing are:

- Elbow: This is a fitting that changes the direction of a pipe by 90 degrees or 45 degrees.
- Tee: This is a fitting that splits a pipe into two branches at 90 degrees.
- Cross: This is a fitting that splits a pipe into four branches at 90 degrees.
- Coupling: This is a fitting that joins two pipes of the same size.
- Reducer: This is a fitting that joins two pipes of different sizes.
- Nipple: This is a short piece of pipe that connects two fittings.
- Union: This is a fitting that allows two pipes to be disconnected without cutting or soldering.
- Valve: This is a fitting that controls the flow of liquid through a pipe by opening or closing.

### Fixtures
  
Fixtures are devices that deliver or receive liquids from the plumbing system. Fixtures can be made of various materials, such as metal, ceramic, or plastic. The most common types of fixtures used in plumbing are:

- Faucet: This is a fixture that controls the flow of water from a pipe by turning a handle or knob.
