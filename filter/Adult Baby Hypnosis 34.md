If you are wondering why baby animals have such a powerful effect on your mood, there are some scientific explanations behind it. One theory is that humans have evolved to respond positively to features that are associated with infants, such as large eyes, round faces, and small noses. These features trigger a nurturing instinct and a release of oxytocin, a hormone that promotes bonding and social connection.
