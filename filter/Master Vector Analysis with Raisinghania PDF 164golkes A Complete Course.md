# Vector Analysis by M. D. Raisinghania: A Review
 
Vector analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vectors and their properties, such as magnitude, direction, addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and so on. Vectors are useful tools for describing physical phenomena in fields such as physics, engineering, mechanics, electromagnetism, and aerodynamics.

One of the books that covers the topic of vector analysis in a comprehensive and rigorous way is *Vector Analysis* by M. D. Raisinghania. This book was first published in 1985 by S. Chand and has since been revised and updated several times. It is intended for students and teachers of mathematics, physics, and engineering who want to learn or review the fundamentals of vector analysis and its applications.
 
The book consists of 12 chapters that cover the following topics:
 
- Introduction to vectors and scalars
- Vector algebra
- Scalar and vector products
- Vector differentiation
- Gradient, divergence, and curl
- Vector integration
- Line, surface, and volume integrals
- Theorems of Gauss, Stokes, and Green
- Curvilinear coordinates
- Tensors and dyadics
- Applications of vector analysis to mechanics
- Applications of vector analysis to electromagnetism

The book is well-organized and clearly written, with definitions, principles, and theorems stated at the beginning of each chapter. It also provides numerous examples and solved problems that illustrate and amplify the theory and help the reader understand the concepts and techniques involved. Moreover, it offers hundreds of additional practice problems with answers at the end of the book for further reinforcement and self-assessment.
 
The book is available in PDF format online for free download from various sources. However, some of these sources may not be reliable or legal, and may contain errors or viruses. One such source is a website that uses the keyword "vector analysis raisinghania pdf 164golkes" to attract visitors who are looking for the book. This website does not provide a valid link to the book, but instead redirects the user to another website that requires registration and payment to access the file.

Vector analysis is a powerful and elegant tool for solving many problems in mathematics and physics. It can help simplify complex calculations, express physical laws in concise forms, and visualize geometric relationships. However, it also requires a solid foundation of algebra, calculus, and geometry to master its concepts and methods.
 
Therefore, it is important to have a good textbook that can guide the reader through the basics and applications of vector analysis in a clear and systematic way. *Vector Analysis* by M. D. Raisinghania is one such textbook that has been widely used and appreciated by students and teachers alike for its comprehensive coverage, rigorous approach, and pedagogical features.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as for self-study and reference. It can also serve as a useful supplement to other standard texts on vector analysis or related topics. It is recommended for anyone who wants to learn or review vector analysis in depth and with confidence.
