Rise of the Witch King is an expansion pack for Battle for Middle Earth II, a popular strategy game based on the Lord of the Rings universe. It adds new factions, heroes, units and maps to the game, as well as many bug fixes and balance changes. However, if you want to play this game without having to insert the CD every time, you will need to follow some steps to install a no-CD crack.
 
A no-CD crack is a modified version of the game executable file that bypasses the CD check. This way, you can run the game from your hard drive without needing the disc. However, you will still need to mount a virtual image of the disc using a software like WinCDEmu, Daemon Tools or Alcohol 52%. This will create a virtual drive on your computer that will act as if you had inserted the disc.

To play Rise of the Witch King without a CD, you will need to download the no-CD files and the latest patch for the game. The no-CD files can be found in our discussion topic[^1^], along with other setup guides. The latest patch is 2.01, which can be downloaded from Mod DB[^2^]. You will also need to download patch 2.02, which is an unofficial patch that fixes many issues and improves the gameplay. You can also download it from Mod DB[^3^].
 
Once you have downloaded all the files, follow these steps:
 
1. Install BFME2 (once installed, you don't need to do anything with it, except patching it if you wish).
2. Install RotWK.
3. Mount the Nocd.mdf file using your virtual drive software. With WinCDEmu installed you can just double click the file and click OK. With other software you may need to open the software, and find the option to mount the file to a new drive.
4. Run RotWK by double clicking on the game shortcut.
5. Download 2.01 patch using the Game Updater. You can do this by going to Multiplayer > Online. You will automatically be prompted to download the patch.
6. Install patch 2.02 by running the installer and following the instructions.

That's it! You should be able to play Rise of the Witch King without a CD. Note: if you restart your computer or shut down your mounting software for some reason, you will need to re-mount the game (see step 3 above) before running it again.

## Why Play Rise of the Witch King?
 
Rise of the Witch King is a great expansion pack for fans of Battle for Middle Earth II and the Lord of the Rings franchise. It adds a lot of new content and features to the game, making it more diverse and enjoyable. Here are some of the reasons why you should play Rise of the Witch King:

- It introduces two new factions: Arnor and Angmar. Arnor is the ancient kingdom of men that was divided into three realms: Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. They have a mix of units from Gondor and Rohan, as well as some unique ones like Hobbit Archers and Dunedain Rangers. Angmar is the realm of the Witch King, the leader of the Nazgul. They have a dark and twisted army of orcs, trolls, wargs and sorcerers, as well as some powerful heroes like Rogash and Morgomir.
- It adds new units and heroes to the existing factions. For example, Mordor gets Gothmog, the lieutenant of Minas Morgul, and Grond, the battering ram that broke the gates of Minas Tirith. Isengard gets Sharku, the warg rider who attacked Theoden, and Ugluk, the leader of the Uruk-hai scouts. The Elves get Glorfindel, the mighty lord of Rivendell, and Thranduil, the king of Mirkwood. The Dwarves get Gloin, Gimli's father, and King Dain Ironfoot.
- It adds new maps and scenarios to the game. You can play on famous locations from the books and movies, such as Fornost, Carn Dum, Amon Sul and Dol Guldur. You can also play on custom maps created by the community or by yourself using the World Builder tool. You can also try new game modes like War of the Ring, which is a turn-based strategy mode where you can conquer Middle Earth with your chosen faction.
- It improves the gameplay and balance of the game. Patch 2.02 fixes many bugs and glitches that were present in the original game and patch 2.01. It also makes many changes to the units, heroes, buildings and powers to make them more balanced and fun to use. It also adds new features like zooming in and out with the mouse wheel, customizing your hotkeys, changing your camera angle and more.

Rise of the Witch King is a must-have for any fan of Battle for Middle Earth II and Lord of the Rings. It offers hours of entertainment and challenge for both single-player and multiplayer modes. If you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for? Download it now and join the battle!
