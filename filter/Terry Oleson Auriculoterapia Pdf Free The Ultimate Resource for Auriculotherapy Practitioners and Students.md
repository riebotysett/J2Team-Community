Auriculotherapy is based on the idea that the ear is a microcosm of the whole body, and that stimulating specific points on the ear can affect corresponding organs, systems and functions. Auriculotherapy was developed in the 1950s by a French physician named Paul Nogier, who observed that patients with sciatica experienced relief when their ears were cauterized. He then mapped out the ear according to the inverted image of a fetus, and discovered that stimulating different parts of the ear could treat various conditions. Nogier's work was later expanded by other researchers and practitioners around the world, who developed different systems and techniques of ear acupuncture.
 
Auriculotherapy can be used to treat a wide range of physical and psychological disorders, such as pain, addiction, stress, anxiety, insomnia, allergies, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances and more. Auriculotherapy can also be used to enhance general health and well-being, as well as to prevent diseases. Auriculotherapy can be performed with needles, seeds, pellets, magnets, lasers or electrical stimulation. Auriculotherapy is usually safe and effective, with minimal side effects and contraindications. However, auriculotherapy should be performed by a qualified and experienced practitioner, who can diagnose and treat each individual according to their specific needs and conditions.
