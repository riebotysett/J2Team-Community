## What is DXF?
 
DXF stands for Drawing Exchange Format. It is a file format that is widely used in CAD software, such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, and SolidWorks. DXF files contain vector graphics data that can be used to create 2D or 3D drawings and models. DXF files can also store additional information such as layers, colors, blocks, and text.
 
## Why Convert SDR to DXF?
 
Converting SDR files to DXF files can be useful for several reasons. For example, you might want to:
 
- Import your survey data into CAD software to create drawings and models based on your measurements.
- Edit your survey data in CAD software to make corrections or adjustments.
- Share your survey data with other professionals who use CAD software.
- Archive your survey data in a standard and compatible format.
