## How to Update BIOS on Samsung NP100NZC
 
Another important driver that you may need to update on your Samsung NP100NZC netbook is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). The BIOS is a firmware that controls the booting process and the communication between the hardware and the operating system. Updating the BIOS can improve the performance, stability, and security of your netbook. However, updating the BIOS is a risky procedure that can cause serious problems if done incorrectly. Therefore, you should only update the BIOS if you are experiencing issues with your netbook or if there is a new version available that fixes known bugs or adds new features.
 
### Step 1: Check Your Current BIOS Version
 
The first step is to check your current BIOS version and compare it with the latest version available on the Samsung website. To check your current BIOS version, follow these steps:
 
- Turn on your netbook and press F2 repeatedly to enter the BIOS setup menu.
- On the main screen, look for the BIOS version information at the bottom right corner. It should be in the format of PxxRxx, where xx are numbers.
- Note down your current BIOS version and exit the BIOS setup menu by pressing F10 and selecting Yes.

### Step 2: Download the Latest BIOS Version
 
The second step is to download the latest BIOS version for your Samsung NP100NZC netbook from the Samsung website. To download the latest BIOS version, follow these steps:

- Go to [https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/np100nzc](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/np100nzc) and enter your netbook's model number in the search bar at the top right.
- Select Software Update from the left menu and scroll down to find the BIOS update file. It should be in the format of PxxRxx.exe, where xx are numbers.
- Compare the BIOS version number with your current BIOS version number. If they are different, click on Download to download the file. If they are the same, you do not need to update your BIOS.
- Save the file to a USB flash drive or an external hard drive that is formatted in FAT32.

### Step 3: Update Your BIOS
 
The third step is to update your BIOS using the downloaded file. To update your BIOS, follow these steps:

- Connect your USB flash drive or external hard drive to your netbook and turn it off.
- Turn on your netbook and press F10 repeatedly to enter the Boot Menu.
- Select USB HDD or USB Memory from the list of boot options and press Enter.
- A black screen will appear with a message saying "Samsung System BIOS Update". Press any key to continue.
- The BIOS update process will start automatically. Do not turn off your netbook or disconnect your USB device during this process. It may take several minutes to complete.
- When the BIOS update is finished, your netbook will restart automatically.

### Step 4: Verify Your BIOS Update
 
The final step is to verify that your BIOS update was successful. To verify your BIOS update, follow these steps:

- Turn on your netbook and press F2 repeatedly to enter the BIOS setup menu.
- On the main screen, look for the BIOS version information at the bottom right corner. It should match with the latest version that you downloaded.
- If the BIOS version is correct, exit the BIOS setup menu by pressing F10 and selecting Yes.
- If the BIOS version is incorrect or if you encounter any problems with your netbook after updating the BIOS, contact Samsung customer support for assistance.
