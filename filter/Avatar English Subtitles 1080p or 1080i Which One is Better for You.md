If you are wondering what makes Avatar such a captivating movie, you may want to know more about its plot and characters. The movie follows the journey of Jake Sully, a former Marine who lost his legs in a war on Earth. He is offered a chance to participate in the Avatar Program, a scientific project that allows humans to remotely control genetically engineered bodies of the Na'vi, the native inhabitants of Pandora. The purpose of the program is to establish diplomatic relations with the Na'vi and persuade them to relocate from their home tree, which stands above a large deposit of unobtanium, a valuable mineral that the humans want to mine.
 
Jake is assigned to work with Dr. Grace Augustine, a botanist and the leader of the Avatar Program, and Norm Spellman, another avatar driver and anthropologist. They are accompanied by Trudy Chacon, a sympathetic pilot, and monitored by Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of security for the human colony. Quaritch promises Jake that he will restore his legs if he gathers intelligence on the Na'vi and their defenses. Jake agrees, but soon finds himself conflicted as he becomes fascinated by the beauty and complexity of Pandora and its wildlife. He also meets Neytiri, a female Na'vi warrior and the daughter of the clan's leader, who saves his life from a pack of vicious creatures. She takes him to her tribe, where he is accepted as a guest after he passes a test from Eywa, the goddess of Pandora.
 
Jake begins to learn the ways of the Na'vi under Neytiri's guidance. He discovers that they have a strong connection with nature and each other through a neural network that links all living things on Pandora. He also falls in love with Neytiri, who reciprocates his feelings. However, his loyalty is tested when he is exposed as a spy by Quaritch, who launches an attack on the Na'vi's home tree with a fleet of armed helicopters and bulldozers. Jake tries to warn the Na'vi and help them fight back, but they are overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the humans. The home tree is destroyed, along with many Na'vi lives.
 
Jake is captured by Quaritch and Grace is shot during the escape. They are transferred to their human bodies and taken to the colony's base. There, they are rescued by Trudy and Norm, who have joined a group of renegade scientists and soldiers who oppose Quaritch's actions. They fly back to Pandora and join forces with the remaining Na'vi clans, who have gathered for a final stand against the humans at the sacred Tree of Souls. Jake prays to Eywa to help them in their battle.
 
The next day, an epic war erupts between the Na'vi and the humans. The Na'vi are aided by various animals and plants of Pandora, who respond to Eywa's call. Jake confronts Quaritch in his avatar body and manages to kill him after a fierce fight. However, he also finds out that his human body has been exposed to Pandora's toxic atmosphere and is dying. Neytiri rushes to his side and holds him in her arms. She sees his human face for the first time and tells him that she sees him as he truly is. Jake smiles and closes his eyes.
 
The movie ends with Jake undergoing a ritual that transfers his consciousness permanently into his avatar body. He opens his eyes again and sees Neytiri smiling at him. They embrace as they are surrounded by their friends and family.
